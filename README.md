# Zelda Tactics RPG
main player menu
A Legend of Zelda-themed tactics RPG, with various characters, enemies, and items from the Zelda universe!
The battle scenes use the Point and Click scene type, as I think this gives it the most flexibility for the player to check on whatever they'd like at a given time.
Check your items? Click yourself and do so.
Get an enemy bio? It'll be right there under their respective menu(s).
I want it to feel *something* like Final Fantasy Tactics, but not be an outright knockoff. For starters, it's not an isometric view. I did try that at first, and there are some placeholder graphics in the assets folder still if you'd like to check them out, but I think a straight up grid will be easier to manage overall.
### So far, the game contains:
- A basic UI upon pressing Select, with health and magic (AP, basically, letting you use items and spells)

- A defend mechanic that adds 1 defense to your player for the next round of enemy turns

- Ideas for basic enemies (Octoroks, Moblins)
- Ideas for various weapons (bow+arrow, bombs, and others), as well as possible stats/characteristics for each

- Some menus when you click on various things (a player turn menu, and an enemy stats/characteristics menu so far)

- A general direction for the art, which is just basically the NES Legend of Zelda's aesthetic recreated, with a few tweaks here and there

### A(n ever-growing) TODO list
- Movement logic
- Attack logic
- Bosses
- A menu/map system for between battle scenes OR a live overworld you can walk around in, I haven't decided which yet
- A main pause menu where you can equip armor and weapons, check items and spells, save, and do all the other regular RPG-type things
- tile swapping for terrain tiles, to show ranges of movement and attacks, and probably other things too so I can save sprites
- Definitely more as they come up  

I really think this should be doable within the parameters of GB Studio, and the Game Boy platform in general.
